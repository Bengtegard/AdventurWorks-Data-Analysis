### **Executive Summary**

The analysis reveals a decline in median customer spending from 2012 to 2013, indicating underperformance of the yearâ€™s marketing campaigns and the need for further evaluation. **Clothing** is the most cost-efficient product category, while **Mountain-200 Black/Silver** is the most profitable product line, with the Black, 38 variant contributing $679,003 in profit.

Regionally, **Europe** leads in revenue with improving profit margins by 2014, **North America** faces profitability challenges despite high revenue, and **Pacific** excels in profit margins, suggesting strong cost management. Country-level data highlights profitability strengths in **Australia** (32.5%) and **Germany** (21.8%), contrasting with weaker margins in the **United States** (4.2%) and **Canada** (3.0%).

Order volume surged from 43 (May 2011) to a peak of 2,400 (May 2014) before declining to 939, reflecting potential market saturation. Revenue trends show steady growth until a February 2014 dip, followed by a record $8.1M in March 2014.
